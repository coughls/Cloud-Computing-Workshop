## Practicals
Practical work was carried out in a Classroom setup on AWS Educate [AWS Educate](https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate/). See [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/awseducate-onboarding/Educator+Toolkit/Movies/Student+Onboarding+Process.mp4) for an overview of how it works. 

This requires the instructor to sign-up to AWS Educate as an instructor. One approved,you can then create a classroom, submit it for approval by AWS Educate and invite students.
To sign-in, students click the link that they have been sent and students were instructed to create AWS Educate Starter Accounts when given the option.

The activity used in this workshop was the 'SSH into Amazon EC2 Activity' (available via AWS Educate) which involves launching an EC2 instance via the AWS Management Console, enabling and disabling SSH access, using SSH keys to access the instance, resizing the instance and terminating it upon completion. This activity takes students approxminately 1 hour.
